FuzzySEO Booster embeds long tail search queries on your pages to increase search engine traffic! 


== Description ==

Fuzzy SEO Booster increases your sites search engine positions for long tail keywords automatically!

Here is how it works: When someone finds your site using a long tail keyword combination not already on that page, it records it, and adds it to the page in a widget box! Think of it as an auto generated tag cloud for your blog, every tag on it helping your search engine positions!


This plugin was written by the site admin at http://seoforums.org - where you can find out more about wordpress seo!


== Installation ==

1) Upload the Fuzzy SEO Booster plugin to your blog.

2) Activate it. 

3) Place it on your site as a widget where you want it to appear!


--ADVANCED USAGE (optional)--

you can also place it in templates by adding: 
seoqueries-get-page-terms($plain-test = false)

NOTE: this should be in "php wrappers", and those DASHES should be UNDERSCORES!!



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: Will this increase my search engine traffic?

A: Yes, it will - it is a technique that some very large and popular websites already use, you wont see results instantly, as the search engines need to spider each page again, but you should see results in 3-5 weeks.  Increases will be incremental on your existing traffic.

== Do I have to pay for this plugin? ==

NO! you DONT have to pay anything for the plugin, nor do you need to make a donation, I am treating this plugin and the free provision of it as LINKWARE - if you want to use it, please either keep the link in the widget intact, if you feel you cant live with that link there, then please stick it in the footer of your website.  If you cant live with a link to me at all, please dont use the plugin, its only fair! thanks!
